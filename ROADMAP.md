# Ares — Future Plans & Ideas

## Capital Planning

### Starting Capital: $1,000
- 5 positions max at ~$200 each (20% per trade)
- Keep 25% cash reserve ($250)
- Commission impact: IBKR ~$1/trade = 0.5% cost on $200 position
- Revisit position sizing when capital grows

### Scaling Plan
| Capital | Max Positions | Per Trade | Cash Reserve |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| $1,000 | 5 | $150-200 | $250 |
| $2,500 | 6 | $300-350 | $750 |
| $5,000 | 8 | $500 | $1,500 |
| $10,000+ | 8-10 | $1,000 | $3,000 |

## Slot Management (When All Positions Full)

### Problem
With max 5-8 positions and 2-4 week holds, system will be fully loaded
and ignore new signals for weeks. Missed opportunities.

### Solution A: Watchlist Queue
- When all slots full, log signal as "queued" with timestamp
- When a trade closes, check queue for still-valid signals
- Auto-enter the strongest queued signal (re-verify RSI, regime, confluence)
- Queue expires after 5 days (signal may no longer be valid)
- Never miss an opportunity — just delay it

### Solution B: Scale Out (Partial Exit)
- When TP hits: sell 50% of position, lock in profit
- Let remaining 50% ride with trailing stop
- Frees up ~50% of capital for new trades
- Example:
  - Buy 10 shares at $100 ($1,000 position)
  - TP hits at $112: sell 5 shares (+$60 profit locked)
  - Remaining 5 shares ride with trailing stop
  - $500 freed for next signal

### Solution C: Replace Weakest
- New signal with confluence 4 appears, all slots full
- Compare with weakest open trade (lowest confluence, worst P&L)
- If new signal significantly stronger: close weakest, enter new
- Risk: closes a trade that might have recovered
- Only for advanced phase

### Recommended Implementation Order
1. Watchlist Queue (Phase 3) — low risk, high value
2. Scale Out (Phase 4) — when auto-executing trades via IBKR
3. Replace Weakest (Phase 5) — needs AI judgment (Claude)

## Phase 3: AI Analysis (Claude API)

### Purpose
- Deep-dive 5-10 signal candidates per day
- Check news, earnings, lawsuits, sector outlook
- Validate or reject Ares signals before entry
- Estimated cost: $0.15-0.30/day ($5-9/month)

### Claude Could Also
- Analyze shadow tracking data → suggest optimal TP levels
- Review weekly performance → suggest parameter adjustments
- Explain WHY a trade worked or failed (pattern recognition)
- Identify sector rotation trends across multiple signals

---

## Phase 4: Automated Execution (IBKR)

### Order Types
- Limit buy at signal price or slightly below
- Stop-loss order placed immediately after fill
- Trailing stop order (8% from peak)
- Scale-out: sell 50% at TP, adjust trailing stop for remainder

### Safety Guards
- Max daily orders: 3
- Max position size: 20% of portfolio
- Kill switch: stop all trading if portfolio down 5% in a week
- Paper trade for 3 months minimum before going live

---

## Phase 5: Portfolio Optimization

### Ideas
- Correlation check: don't hold 3 tech stocks at once
- Sector balancing: max 2 positions per sector
- Volatility adjustment: reduce position size for high-vol stocks
- Dynamic trailing stop: tighter for range trades, wider for momentum
- Backtest engine: test parameter changes on historical data before applying

## Parameter Tuning Ideas (After Collecting Data)

| Parameter | Current | Consider |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| RSI period | 21 | Test 14 vs 21 vs 28 |
| RSI source | OHLC4 | Test Close vs OHLC4 vs HLC3 |
| Min confluence | 2 | Increase to 3 for higher win rate? |
| Trailing stop | 8% | Test 5% vs 8% vs 10% |
| TP momentum | 12% | Shadow data will tell us |
| TP reversal | 8% | Shadow data will tell us |
| Max positions | 8 | Start with 5 for $1,000 capital |

### Decision Rule
Only change parameters after 50+ closed trades with shadow data.
Never optimize based on 5-10 trades — too small a sample.

---

## Dual Timeframe Strategy (Future)

### Daily (current)
- Signal generation: RSI, divergence, regime, confluence
- Runs at market open + close

### Intraday (future with IBKR)
- Hourly candles for better entry timing
- "Daily says BUY → wait for hourly pullback → enter"
- Could improve entry price by 1-2%
- Needs IBKR streaming data subscription ($1.50/month)

---

## Notes
- Paper trade minimum 3 months before going live
- Need 50+ closed trades for statistically meaningful data
- Shadow tracking data is critical for TP optimization
- Start real money only when profit factor > 1.3 consistently
